 <h1>Edge, Edge and Edgy: The Birth of a Cultural Icon</h1>
 <div style="height:200px;width:75%;overflow:auto;background-color:darkred;color:white;scrollbar-base-color:gold;font-family:'Aldrich',sans-serif;padding:10px; font-size: 20px;">DOOM (1993) was developed by id Software as a science fiction/horror first person shooter.
DOOM isnâ€™t just famous: its infamous. Infamous for gore, cutting edge 3d styled graphics, satanic imagery and inspiring the First Person Shooter game genre.<br>
DOOM had some of the most intuitive level design seen in a game back in the days of floppy disks. It gave birth to one of the most active modding communities, people are still creating new DOOM WADs.<br>
DOOM faced controversy because of violence and satanic imagery. During the investigation of the columbine school schooting, it was discovered that one of the shooters (Eric Harris) played DOOM. This spawned a particularly gruesome rumor that Harris had planned his attack by modeling Columbine High School ingame but this has been proven to be untrue. Harris's DOOM WADs have been found and released and none of them were related to the case. <!-- I found out while researching this project that someone (possibly recently, I can't tell tbh) created a columbine WAD for DOOM featuring the shooters and midi versions of their favorite tunes. There will be no reference to it out of respect for the victims but I didn't want to seem like I hadn't done my research. --> Ironically DOOM's plot is wholesome, in a way. The nameless marine (popularly called doomguy) is simply performing exorcisms with his guns and fists, no humans are harmed in the game, only demons and other hellspawn.
