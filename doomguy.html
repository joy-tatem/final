<h1>My Doom Journey</h1>
<div>I'm not sure what particularly grabbed my interest about DOOM, the series had been in periphrial vision for the majority of my life. I didn't grow up a gamer but knew of the series. Like pokemon and the 24 hour news cycle, DOOM was inescapable at all levels of my schooling. The cool 6th graders had it when I was in 4th grade, I saw the movie in middle school, in college my friends tossed around copies during steam sales. Even as gaming became my primary pastime, I still avoided DOOM, as if I were somehow unworthy of touching it with my filthy, plebian hands.<br> I tried to ignore Bethesda's 2016 DOOM release but finally gave in over the summer. Why? Because a friend informed me of our nameless hero's pet bunny Daisy (who I will avenge until the day I die). I gorged on campaign mode for a few days, eventually clocking in at 26 hours. After beating the game I felt filled with this overwhelming sense of comfort. I tend to favor games that allow me to be the good guy, in RPGs my character is usually some sort of barbarian with a heart of gold. DOOM did not disappoint in this regard. Doomguy is not a good guy. He's the best guy. He's so good that the demons in hell are afraid of HIM. There is something immenesly satisfying about violence being the solution to a cosmic problem. So I sank deeper into the hole. I started scouring the subreddit, I opened google calendar and marked when I was allowed to buy each of the older games so I didn't marathon the whole series over a month. All of that fell apart after a death in the family.<br> I sunk deeper into the hole. Doomguy couldn't bring the dead back but he could give me company. Funerals are the worst combination of family gatherings and formative events. DOOM gave me some normalcy in the off hours. Mourning is exhausting, it was nice to emotionally check out for a bit. Grief is isolating even though we all experience it. In times of trouble people tend to seek comfort from their loved ones or a higher power. I had video games. I was able to play out my ultimate millenial fantasy: making a difference. The hole became my home, I still live here.</div>
